## 🎵 Gesture-Controlled iOS Music Player

An innovative iOS music player application that uses CoreML and Vision frameworks to enable real-time hand gesture recognition for controlling playback. This app allows users to play, pause, skip, and rewind songs using predefined gestures detected through the iPhone’s front camera, offering a touch-free and intuitive user experience.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-Time Gesture Detection:** Seamless, low-latency recognition of hand gestures using a custom-trained CNN model.
- **Touch-Free Music Control:** Perform essential playback actions without touching your device.
- **CoreML Integration:** On-device machine learning for fast, secure processing without needing an internet connection.
- **SwiftUI Interface:** Modern, minimalistic UI inspired by Apple Music for a smooth experience.
- **Lock Screen Live Activity:** Control playback and view song information even when the device is locked.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Swift 6 & SwiftUI
- CoreML & Vision Framework
- Custom CNN Model trained with a self-created hand gesture dataset
- iOS 18.2 | Xcode 16.2

## 📂 Dataset & Model

The model was trained on a custom dataset generated by recording and extracting frames of various hand gestures. These images were preprocessed, labeled, and used to train a Hand Pose Classifier via CreateML, achieving optimized performance for real-time detection.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- **Customizable gestures**
- **Shuffle and sort features for the song library**
- **Enhanced UI elements like a progress bar and dynamic playlists**
